## **Problems Encountered**

1.  **Logo:** I saved my icon in my assets but I realized it's a jpg file and the color cannot be changed and shadow cannot be added, I had to search the same icon in Icons8 and use the link.
2. **Header background picture:** Again, I saved this picture in my assets/images but for some reason, it does not work for me, I'm glad I remembered who and where I took this image from and used the image link for this project. Also hoping, I could change the filter for this background and make it a bit darker but not sure how to do that.
3. **Subscribe form:** could not get the label to center with input box. Could not get the content wrap.
4. **Article (Cards):** Having problems with centering them while being on auto-fit box for grid.
5. **icons:** I'm not sure how to embed icons properly.
